# ABSTRACT: Provides the filter_keywords utility

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Elasticsearch::Compat::Util qw(filter_keywords);

    my $filtered = filter_keywords($unfiltered)

=head1 SUBROUTINES

=head2 filter_keywords()

This tidies up a string to be used as a query string in (eg)
L<Elasticsearch::Compat/"search()"> so that user input won't cause a search query
to return an error.

It is not flexible at all, and may or may not be useful to you.

Have a look at L<Elasticsearch::Compat::QueryParser> which gives you much more control
over your query strings.

The current implementation does the following:

=over

=item * Removes any character which isn't a letter, a number, a space or
  C<-+'"*@._>.

=item * Removes C<and>, C<or> and C<not>

=item * Removes any C<-> that doesn't have a space in front of it ( "foo -bar")
      is acceptable as it means C<'foo' but not with 'bar'>

=item * Removes any space after a C<+> or C<->

=item * Removes any C<+> or C<-> which is not followed by a letter, number
      or a double quote

=item * Removes any C<*> that doesn't have at least 3 letters before it, ie
      we only allow wildcard searches on words with at least 3 characters

=item * Closes any open double quotes

=item * Removes leading and trailing whitespace

=back

YMMV
